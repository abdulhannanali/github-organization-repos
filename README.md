# Github Organization List

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/abdulhannanali/github-organization-repos.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

Github organization list does what it says it does, simple! You enter an organization
name into the input element and it shows you the list of repositories from that organization.

## Everything is in the details

This project is simple at first, but the details come from how it's built, I built 
this project over two days while learning to use Webpack, and the journey with
Webpack has been great so far, as it's quite easy to learn and use.

Configuration is available for two environments for this application:
- [Development](scripts/webpack.dev.js)
- [Production](scripts/webpack.prod.js)

### Features developed

The webpack configuration uses many of Webpack's features, that make it unique
such as:
- Code Splitting
- Predictable Long Term Caching
- Development Server For Production
- Extraction of CSS into separate files 
- and more....

### Final Words

Working with Webpack was exciting and I am now into it, looking forward to make cool stuff 
using Webpack which I and others can use in the future.
